# react-gmap

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple react application using the [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/).

For this app to work on your local, you will need a [Google Map API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key). Once you have the key, you can replace it in `<root>/src/config.js`.
